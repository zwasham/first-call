# Execute Your First Call to the OpenAI API

This repository provides a Jupyter Notebook that you can use to make your first call to the OpenAI API.

## Troubleshooting

If you get an error message in the notebook, try the following steps:
1. Click the "Restart" and "Clear All Outputs" buttons at the top of the notebook, and then re-execute all cells from top to bottom.
2. Make sure that you added an active, funded OpenAI API key as an environment variable (i.e. a GitHub Secret) named OPENAI_API_KEY and that you made this environment variable available to your repository.
3. Create a new repository from the PyFi template and try again.

If none of these solutions fix your problem, please send us an email at support@pyfi.com and we will be happy to assist you.
